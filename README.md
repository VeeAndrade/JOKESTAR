### Abstract 
Jokestar is an app built for awkward individuals like myself to help over come the tension that comes with meeting new people, or just a great joke app. This app was built using React, Redux and Router. There were two API's used for all user data manipulation. 

### Struggles 
- Intent to implement React Hooks but time didn't suffice when it came to testing. 
- Styling might need some adjustments but with time constraints, was difficult to accomplish. 

### Project Goals and Requirements
-   Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of React, Redux, Router, and Asynchronous JavaScript.
-   Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for your audience which helps them in some way. 
-   Your applications should have the following core functionality: -- Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience -- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list
